  Hi, I'm **Risheek Kumar**, a Data Scientist and Indie Hacker based right here in Boston. For the past four years, I've been immersed in the world of data, focusing on solving complex business problems and building intelligent applications that turn insights into action.

  My path started at **American Express**, where I've spent my career honing my skills in data analytics, SQL, Python, and business strategy. It was there I discovered my dual passion for the logical puzzle of data analysis and the creative challenge of building products from the ground up. Since then, I've embraced both, believing that the best solutions come from a deep understanding of the data and a relentless drive to build.

  ### My Approach

  My philosophy is rooted in **analytical rigor** and **first-principles thinking**. I believe great solutions start with a deep understanding of the 'why' â€“ the core business problem and the underlying patterns in the data. I use data exploration, machine learning (including models like OpenAI and LLaMA), and rapid prototyping (with tools like Bubble and Nuxt.js) to ensure the solutions I build are not just accurate, but also practical and scalable.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex datasets into clear, actionable insights and functional products. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a strategy I've informed with data come to life and drive real business growth, or launching a side project that solves a real-world problem.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not analyzing data or coding, you might find me sharpening my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, following the latest chess tournaments, or exploring new ideas for my next side project.
