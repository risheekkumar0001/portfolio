    - title: Work & Skills
      questions:
        - label: What are your primary skills?
          content: |
            My core skills are in data analytics and business strategy. Technically, I'm strong in SQL for data manipulation and analysis, and Python for scripting and machine learning. I also have hands-on experience with ML models like OpenAI and LLaMA, and I'm proficient with development tools like Bubble for rapid prototyping and Nuxt.js for web applications.
        - label: What is your approach to problem-solving?
          content: |
            I focus on understanding the fundamental patterns of a problem before diving into a solution. Whether it's a LeetCode challenge (like graph or DP problems) or a business case, I structure my thinking, create a mental map, and then execute. I often use AI as a coding partner to accelerate development while I focus on the high-level strategy.
        - label: Are you open to new opportunities?
          content: |
            I am always open to exploring challenging roles that allow me to grow faster, both in terms of career progression and earnings. I'm particularly interested in positions where I can leverage my data science skills to make a significant business impact and contribute to product development.
    - title: Side Projects
      questions:
        - label: What kind of side projects have you built?
          content: |
            As an indie hacker, I enjoy building full-stack applications. I've created clones of popular apps like Upwork (Downwork) and Instagram (Cinstagram) using Bubble to master no-code development and Stripe integration. I'm currently building a resume builder using Nuxt.js, Firebase, and Firestore to sharpen my front-end and backend skills.
        - label: Why do you build side projects?
          content: |
            Side projects are my sandbox for learning and innovation. They allow me to apply data science concepts in new ways, experiment with the latest technologies like Nuxt for its SEO and SSR capabilities, and stay hands-on with the entire product development lifecycle, from idea to deployment.
        - label: What other ideas are you exploring?
          content: |
            I'm constantly exploring new ideas. Currently, I'm conceptualizing a Chrome extension to autofill forms from resumes, which would streamline job applications. I'm also experimenting with smaller, fun projects like a chess Elo comparison app and a tournament manager.
    - title: About Me
      questions:
        - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
          content: |
            I love the process of transforming raw data into a clear, compelling story that drives action. It's incredibly satisfying to solve a complex puzzle and see my insights lead to a tangible business outcome. As a builder, I also get a huge thrill from creating a functional app or tool that people can use.
        - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
          content: |
            When I'm not analyzing data or coding, I enjoy practicing for competitive programming on LeetCode, exploring new tech articles, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm also an avid chess player and enjoy following major tournaments.
